This YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etx0k1nLn78) contains some
interesting discussion about misleading statistical analyses of the 2020 US
election results. At one point, the presenter uses a histogram of the first
2,069 pairs of digits in pi as point of comparison.

Let's recreate this graphic using R. The first million digits of pi have been
provided in `data/pi_dec_1m.txt`. The `readr` package from the `tidyverse`
provides a `read_file` function we can use to load the data.

What does the distribution look like? Does it match the one shown in the video?
Does the distribution change if we use a larger sample?

```{R}
