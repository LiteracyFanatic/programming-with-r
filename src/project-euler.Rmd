## [Question 2](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2)

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two
terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed
four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

```{R}
a <- 0
b <- 1
c <- a + b
sum <- 0

while (c <= 4e6) {
    if (c %% 2 == 0) {
        sum <- sum + c
    }
    a <- b
    b <- c
    c <- a + b
}

sum
```

## [Question 5](https://projecteuler.net/problem=5)

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to
10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the
numbers from 1 to 20?

```{R}
test <- function(n) {
    all(n %% 1:20 == 0)
}

n <- 20
while (!test(n)) {
   n <- n + 20
}

n
```
