# Functions

This is not good code. Why? Because we repeated a huge chunk of information,
with only a few minor changes. Duplication is evil. Copy and paste is a great way
to write spaghetti code.

The answer is an abstraction called a function. Functions let us describe
actions or computations that are similar in structure but have different inputs.
That way we only have to write the parts that differ.

DRY = Don't Repeat Yourself
DRY code is good code!

```{R}

greet <- function(first_name, last_name, is_married, age) {
    if (is.na(is_married)) {
        paste("Hello Ms", last_name)
    } else {
        if (is_married && (age > 18 || gender == "female")) {
            paste("Hello Mrs.", last_name)
        } else if (age > 18) {
            paste("Hello Miss", last_name)
        } else {
            paste("Hello", first_name)
        }
    }
}

# No repetition!
greet("Sue", "Thomas", FALSE, 16)
greet("Zoey", "Bryant", TRUE, 23)
```

```{R}

greet <- function(first_name, last_name, is_married = FALSE, age) {
    if (is.na(is_married)) {
        paste("Hello Ms", last_name)
    } else {
        if (is_married && (age > 18 || gender == "female")) {
            paste("Hello Mrs.", last_name)
        } else if (age > 18) {
            paste("Hello Miss", last_name)
        } else {
            paste("Hello", first_name)
        }
    }
}

# No repetition!
greet(age = 20, first_name = "Jasmine", last_name = "Patterson", is_married = FALSE)
greet(age = 20, first_name = "Jasmine", last_name = "Patterson")
greet(age = 20, first_name = "Jasmine", last_name = "Patterson", is_married = TRUE)
```
